# structit
A web based colaborativ Outliner/Mindmapping Tool

Have you ever tried to draw a mindmap on a computer? A problem might be, your thoughts are faster than selecting a new Bubble and drag it into the view and connect it and type sth in...

# I want to develop a tool that is as fast as your thougts.
Driven by simple shortcuts and smart drawing algorithms.
